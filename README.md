## MaterialTextBox
A custom UWP control that tries to implement the design and functionality for material text fields documented at [material.io](https://material.io)

The control contains a normal TextBox with a custom template that almost removes all the traditional styling. Warpped arround that is are some other controls that are used to implement the desired material design and functionality.

### Features

- Text (simple text input)
- Label (depending on focus and text input is above or in top of the Text)
- Placeholder text (shows when control is in focus and the text input is empty)
- Auto complete text (shows when control is in focus, enter button to auto complete, custom event fires, auto complete > placeholder)
- Some Animations (visual feedback when in focus or hovering)
- Invalid state - control changes colour and an error text is shown (if supplied)
- Max. character count
- Segoe MDL2 Assets that are displayed next to the control
- Helper text below the control
- Button to clear text input

You are welcome to use this custom control but please use it with caution. I am relatively new to UWP controls. I would appreciate help and suggestions for improvements very much!
